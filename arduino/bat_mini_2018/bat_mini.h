/*
 *     
 *  3V3/5V - This wire is optional and can be used to power your circuit during testing. You can power your circuit only when the 
 *  current demand is limited (less than 500 mA). This wire is usually red (color may be vary).
    GND - This wire is required and should be connected to pin 4 on the ATtiny85 (or to whatever point you designated as ground). 
    This wire is usually black (color may be vary).
    TX - This wire is used by the external device to send data to your ATtiny85. This wire should be connected to the pin you 
    designated as RX when you setup your Software Serial instance. On FTDI cables, this wire is usually orange. On the USB to TTL 
    Serial Cable this wire is usually green (color may be vary).
    RX - This wire is used by the external device to receive data from your ATtiny85. This wire should be connected to the pin 
    you designated as TX when you setup your Software Serial instance. On FTDI cables, this wire is usually yellow. On the USB 
    to TTL Serial Cable this wire is usually white (color may be vary).
